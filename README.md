# Coursera-Deep-Learning Specialization

contains all the jupyter notebooks AND all the necessary libraries needed to run the notebooks that reside on the coursera server. Cloning other git repos with just the ipnyb files will not allow the notebooks to run as they will have missing dependencies that are only available here.

I recommend having conda installed to open the jupyter notebooks with proper dependencies.
